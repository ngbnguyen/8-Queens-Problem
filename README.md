Local Search (Local Search):
The search algorithms that we have looked at so far are designed to browse in some system's search space. The system calculates by keeping in a memory or multiple paths and by noting what has been reviewed along the way and which has not. When the target is found, the path to this goal is also the solution to the problem.

In some problems, to find the most optimal (global optimization) requires a lot of resources and computation costs, especially problems that do not search very wide, infinite or near as infinite. Do that, the search on the best solution for the worksheet that near as not be, or only can be found for the your value start near the end of the point.

For such problems, the local search algorithm (Local Search) is the commonly applied method. Local search algorithm uses a single current state (instead of many different paths) and only transitions to neighboring state. Usually, the paths in the search process are not retained.

Local Search algorithm has two outstanding advantages:
1. Uses very little memory, usually a fixed amount.
2. Often a plausible solution can be found in a large or infinite state space.
